## AngularJS Authentication

What this course is about: **How to authenticate our apps with JSON web tokens**.

1.  We're going to use Auth0 to do this.  Auth0 is a service that provides a ncice login box that's ready to go.
2.  We just need to provide some functions in our app to tie into that service.
3.  Once we've done that, we'll be able to get our users profile and token and save those in local storage.
4.  Then we can use that token to make requests for secured resources on our server.
